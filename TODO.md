# TODO List

## Weather & Forecasting
- [ ] Use weather forecast, not synthetic weather
  - Currently generating synthetic future weather data based on historical patterns
  - Should integrate with real weather forecast API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.)
  - This would provide actual predicted air temperatures for more accurate water temperature forecasts

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add more sophisticated gap filling algorithms
- [ ] Implement data validation and outlier detection
- [ ] Add export functionality for different file formats
- [ ] Create mobile-responsive design improvements
- [ ] Add user preferences for temperature units (°C/°F)
- [ ] Implement data backup and versioning
- [ ] Add email notifications for extreme temperatures
- [ ] Create historical comparison features (year-over-year)
